guessing_game
=============

Assignment 1 - Bootcamp

This is a very simple game -- guess how many episodes of The Office there are!

If the user guesses too high or too low, the messaging will reflect that. If the user enters characters that aren't numbers, there is messaging for that as well. 

I referenced w3schools and GitHub help to complete this exercise, as well as consulting with peers Zach and Craig. Craig in particular helped me with the "while" loop to ensure that the user wouldn't have to refresh the page to guess again.
